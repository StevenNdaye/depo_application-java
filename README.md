DepotApplication
================

* Deployed on Jetty web server.
* Maven is used for build automation.
* If you want to run the project in your local machine, make sure that nothing is using port 8080 
  and hit mvn jetty:run in your terminal. 
* Set up your postgres accordingly to run on port 5432 and create within it "depot_application" database.

Still working on it...not yet a finished product.
